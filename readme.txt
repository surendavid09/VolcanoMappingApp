Program will read a list of active volcanoes in the United States. It will
plot the longitude, latitude, and elevation and saves it as Map1.html. This also
renders a layer that will show population as well and color map with
green if population is under 10,000,000, orange if the population is between
10,000,000 and 20,000,000, and red if higher that 20,000,000. Layers control implemented 
as well.
